Inspiration
We wanted to create a flexible multidimensional index to analyze international trade and provide impactful policy recommendations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

What it does
The project builds a multidimensional index to study global trade patterns, using GNNs for flexibility and Explainable AI (XAI) for transparent policy recommendations.

How we built it
We used PCA for dimensionality reduction, Random Forest for feature selection, and developed a GNN to analyze trade. XAI with SHAP values helps explain the model's predictions.

Challenges we ran into
Cleaning and imputing missing data
Feature selection and deciding the most important indicators
Constructing appropriate edges for the GNN
Accomplishments we're proud of
Creating a flexible index
Building an adaptable GNN model
Using XAI for clear, transparent policy insights
What we learned
The value of data preprocessing and feature selection
Integrating GNNs and XAI for explainable predictions
How to create flexible models that scale with complex datasets
What's next for MPI - SAP Submission
Weâ€™ll refine the model, improve its accuracy, and scale it for larger datasets, while continuing to focus on explainable policy recommendations.
